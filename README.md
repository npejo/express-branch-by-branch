# mean-branch-by-branch

Step by step guide how to setup and develop application using: NodeJS (ExpressJS, PassportJS), MongoDB (mongoosejs), AngularJS.

**Boilerplate** - developers that understand the used technologies and like to skip the configuration part can easy get clean boilerplate for their project, only with the dependencies they need, just checkout to the appropriate branch and start from there.

**Tutorial** - easy to follow setup and development of the example project 'SimpleTasks'. To go through the tutorial checkout branch by branch starting from the `init-folder-structure` branch. The `master` branch has copy of the latest branch of the development of the application. 

All the phases of setting up and development of the example project (initialization, scaffolding, configuration and features development) are split into separate branch.

The tutorial at start assumes that you have already installed `git`, `nodejs`, and have basic understanding of these technologies.

The README.md file in each branch has description of the changes made in the appropriate branch.

Branch list with short description:

1. **master** - Latest version (copy of the last branch in the list)

3. **app-configuration** - Updated scaffolding
4. **passportjs-authentication** - Passportjs initialization, Sign up, Sign in, Sign out action
